Project: Compile a list of recipes that I use everyday

1. Contain mostly vegan/vegan adaptable recipes (GF is vegan, often have to adjust for that)
2. Order by class (eg pastas go together, casseroles, cultural foods and basic stapes)
3. Contain handy links to spice pairings for experimentation
4. Contain food science resources for optimizing palate
