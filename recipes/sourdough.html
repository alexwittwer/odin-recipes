        <h4 class="title">ingredients</h4>
        <ul class="recipeBox">
            <li>900g bread flour</li>
            <li>660g lukewarm water</li>
            <li>18g salt</li>
            <li>100g sourdough starter</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="title">steps</h4>
        <ol class="recipeBox">
            <li>the night before, or roughly 8 hours before mixing, feed your starter a 1:1 mix of flour and water</li>
            <li>in a large bowl, mix the ripe sourdough starter with water, stirring to dissolve</li>
            <li>add the flour and salt, mixing until throughouly incorporated. ensure there is no dry flour</li>
            <li>let the dough rest covered for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>once rested, fold the dough in the bowl from the sides to the center. you can also pick the dough up and
                perform a coil-fold on the dough</li>
            <li>once the gluten has started to tense up and resist, let sit in the bowl for another 30 minutes</li>
            <li>repeat steps 5 and 6 two more times, resting for 30 minutes between folds</li>
            <li>after the final coil fold, let the dough rest in the bowl, covered, until bulk ferment is complete.

                used to estimate bulk rise time
            </li>
            <li>once the dough has fermented and gained size, turn the dough out onto a clean, floured work surface</li>
            <li>cut the dough into two equally sized pieces</li>
            <li>preshape by carefully folding the dough into a ball, starting from the edges and bringing them to the
                center. then, form the dough into a ball.</li>
            <li>let rest <strong>uncovered</strong> for 30 minutes to relax the gluten</li>
            <li>once dough is rested, flip it over to have the sticky side <em>up</em> and then stretch it into a
                square, careful as to not disturb the air pockets</li>
            <li>perform final shaping. i make two loaves, one batard and one boule. a boule is formed the same way as
                the preshape ball, but this time after forming it into a ball, roll the dough on the counter towards you
                with a cupped motion using both hands. this will tighten the dough</li>
            <li>a batard is formed by folding the dough in thirds towards the center like a letter, then rolling it into
                a swiss-roll shape</li>
            <li>place the shaped dough into floured bannetons. a banneton is a vessel for holding dough while it
                completes its proof that keeps the dough from losing its shape</li>
            <li>place the bannetons in the fridge to cold proof overnight, or roughly 12-18 hours</li>
            <li>once the dough has proofed, preheat an oven to 500f/260c with a dutch oven inside</li>
            <li>remove the dough from the fridge, and remove it from the bannetons and place it on a cut sheet of
                parchment paper that will fit the dutch oven.</li>
            <li>using a sharp razor blade or knife, score along the center of the dough at a 15 degree angle, making a
                slight crescent shape from one end to the other</li>
            <li>place the dough gently into the dutch oven, add an ice cube into the dutch oven underneath the parchment
                paper to introduce steam. cover with a lid and bake for 22 minutes</li>
            <li>after the timer expires, remove the lid and reduce temp to 450f/230c and bake for an additional 20
                minutes to develop the crust</li>
            <li>remove the bread, and let rest on a bread rack for at least 1 hour before serving</li>
            <li>repeat steps 19 to 23 for the remaining loaf</li>
        </ol>
